FreeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Course - Building a Survey Form

From the FreeCodeCamp project description:
"Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP."

I generally followed the script on this one and tried to get my page to look like the example page (except for background color, font, and images).
